# Spyridon-V2

**Minecraft Modpack for CurseForge 1.20.1 – Forge Edition**

## How to Download

Downloading the modpack is as easy as clicking a button. You can find the original project page here: [CurseForge Spyridon-V2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/spy).

To install, simply click the **Install** button. If you don’t have the CurseForge launcher, you may be prompted to install it. Alternatively, you can download the modpack directly without the launcher by selecting the **Download** button next to Install.

## Reporting Issues

You can report any issues with the modpack in the **Issues** section of this GitHub repository. When reporting a crash, please include the crash log file so we can better understand what triggered the issue.

- **If Minecraft crashes before loading**, you’ll likely find the crash log in the `SpyridonV2\crash-reports` folder. Ensure the date on the file matches the time of the crash; otherwise, it may not be the correct report.
    
- **If Minecraft crashes after loading**, the log file is located in `SpyridonV2\logs`. Look for the `latest.log` file, especially if you opened it immediately after the crash. If not, find the log file that corresponds to the crash time and date.

## Modpack Wiki

The wiki may not be available yet, but once it’s live, you can access it under the **Wiki** tab on this GitHub repo. While it might not cover every detail, it will provide useful guidance and support for any questions you have.

## Modpack Overview

The aim of Spyridon-V2 is to maintain a Vanilla Minecraft feel while enhancing the experience with additional helpful features. Magic items and relics are included, though optional—you can easily rely on powerful armor options without needing to use magic-based items.

## Modpack Files

You might wonder why partial modpack files are uploaded here on GitHub when the full version is already on CurseForge. These files serve as backups in case you’ve modified any configuration and accidentally caused issues. If you encounter corrupt or broken files, you can replace them with the ones provided here.

## Modpack Images

All modpack images have been moved from Imgur to GitHub to preserve their quality and accessibility. If you’d like to use these images as wallpapers or YouTube thumbnails, feel free to do so. They can be found in the `\images` folder on this repository.

## Conclusion

While the modpack isn’t perfect, I continuously work to improve configurations and add fun elements. I’m always open to feedback (though none has been submitted yet!) and aim to fix any issues as they arise.

This modpack was inspired by two friends playing together and enjoying the game. The initial version, built on Minecraft 1.16.2, had stability issues, often crashing within 30 minutes. With limited logs and knowledge, I couldn’t resolve those issues, which led to the creation of Spyridon V2.

Spyridon V2 was carefully rebuilt from scratch. Now, if issues occur, I can easily identify and fix them, whether by adjusting the configuration or removing problematic mods. I also maintain a notebook of every change, which I later compile into detailed patch notes. Each update has a unique name and summary for quick reference, ensuring no updates will corrupt your world. I also provide reminders about unstable dimensions to avoid loading conflicts with updated chunks.

This project holds a special place in my heart, and I’m committed to making each update as polished and stable as possible.
